# The Last Human Algorithm — Interactive Digital Archive

Welcome to **The Last Human Algorithm**, an interactive digital archive exploring the intersection of human storytelling and artificial intelligence. This project investigates how large language models (LLMs) and other AI systems reconstruct narratives from fragmented memories, posthuman affect, and hybridized cognitive processes. By juxtaposing human-authored and AI-generated microfiction, the archive illuminates patterns, differences, and convergences in creative expression.

## 🔹 Purpose of the Site

The primary goal of this project is to examine the evolving boundary between human and machine authorship. Specifically, the archive seeks to:

1. **Explore Human-AI Collaboration:** Demonstrate how AI can act as a co-creator in experimental fiction and narrative reconstruction.
2. **Analyze Narrative Patterns:** Highlight stylistic, semantic, and emotional differences between human-authored and AI-generated texts.
3. **Encourage Critical Engagement:** Provide a user-friendly interface for exploring how machine learning models interpret memory, emotion, and imaginative content.
4. **Preserve Intellectual and Ethical Standards:** Document AI usage responsibly while respecting human authorship and existing intellectual property.

Through this project, users can interact with the archive, compare texts, and reflect on the co-evolution of human creativity and AI-assisted narrative construction.
